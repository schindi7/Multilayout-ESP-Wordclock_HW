# Multilayout-ESP-Wordclock_HW
This is the first unofficial enclosure for the [Multilayout-ESP-Wordclock](https://github.com/ESPWortuhr/Multilayout-ESP-Wordclock). The currently supported layout is a 10x11 with the 4 LEDs in the corner (total 114 LEDs). The dimensions are 240 x 240 mm. In the future, maybe more than one front plates will be available, but we will see how it goes.
